GAMES-SCOREBOARD

Games::Scoreboard is a Perl project to manage and manipulate scoreboard,
players and scores.

Sometimes I play something, and I need to register points by player, to have
the top scorers, and sometimes I would like to have also an history of
ranking.

I wanted persistance and I implemented the possibility to save in (and load
from) XML data file.
I wanted "easy mode" to insert data and I created GUI (first Curses::UI to
allow data entry by remote-terminal).

It's my desire the whole project had a strong trend for the decoupling, so
GUI(s) draws only, the XML model just reads and writes, and Games::Scoreboard
lib map data. I hope this may help to develop plugins and useful features.

WHY MOUSE?
(and not Moose or Moo or other OOP modules)

I appreciate the idea to create constructor, accessors and OOP logic easily
and fast.
I don't prefer an OO module on the others: I've choosen Mouse because the game
has started all this in my mind was about mices. ;-)

If you are interested in benchmarks about OO you can read here:
