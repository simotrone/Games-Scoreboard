GAMES-SCOREBOARD

Games::Scoreboard is a Perl project to manage and manipulate scoreboard,
players and scores.

Sometimes I play to something, and I need to register points by player,
to have the top scorers, and sometimes I would like to have also an
history of ranking.

I wanted persistance and I implemented saving in (and loading from) XML
file.
I wanted "easy mode" to insert data and I created GUI (first Curses::UI
to allow data entry by remote-terminal).

It's my desire that all the project had a strong trend for the decoupling,
so GUI(s) draws only, the XML model just read and write, etc. I hope this
help to develop plugins and useful features.

WHY MOUSE?
(and not Moose or Moo or other OOP modules)

I appreciate the idea to create constructor, accessors and OOP logic easily and
fast.
I don't prefer an OO module on the others: I choose Mouse because the game that
start all this in my mind was about mices. ;-)

If you interested to benchmark about OO you can read here:
